<h3> The Workshop </h3>

After weeks of planning and discussing how i'll go about hosting my empathy workshop, what a moment it was to finally be standing in front of my participants as I hosted it.

I held the Drawing To See: Empathy Workshop at ITP on a Thursday evening. It was held in a room with 6 people, mostly ITP students.

We began by each writing 15 facts about someone we personally know very well, and someone that is pretty different from everyone in the room.

We then created playlists of about 10 songs that best represented the person.

We exchanged our playlists and facts with someone else and then grabbed a large poster sheet of paper and crayons. We spent about an hour creating portraits based on the facts and music we received.

When we finished, we put up our portraits and had a mini art show. Everyone was able to view each other's portraits and read the facts that inspired them.

We wrapped up the workshop with a reflection, discussion and critique. This part of the workshop was one of the most insightful parts for me as it allowed me to learn how others might perceive the activity and how to go about it in the future. I've attached the recording of our discussion on my personal site.
