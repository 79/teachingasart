Daniella's workshop began with us creating a bubble together on a slide. We observed it, made it pop, and created it again.

Immediately after that, we viewed a similar bubble in a VR headset. [Link here](https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/bubble/)

She then asked me what the difference between the two was. After a lot of tries, I gave up. She expected me to notice that the real bubble popped, but the virtual one did not. 

The next part of the workshop was hands-on again. I was given three pieces of paper and a pencil, and was asked to visualize space, time and light, which I did by just folding the paper. 

We then looked at the work of [Tomas Saraceno](http://tomassaraceno.com/), and discussed the unknown, our existence within the unknown, and how it related to life and the presentation itself.

At the end, Dani asked that I think about the bubbles of topics I find myself interested in, and dig deeper to find projects that help me explore those topics.

Overall, the workshop was quite interesting. I really enjoyed the real world observation of the bubble, and the hands-on making of them. I understood that the entire workshop was to present the idea of interconnectedness, but I feel that could be given more importance in the way it was presented. I loved the exploration of Saraceno's work as well. One note that I had was regarding the workshop was about how this would be presented to larger groups. I feel this works great with groups of upto 5 people, but might be difficult to handle with too many people.
