# designing a curriculum\
###A bit of background from a person who did high school in a private catholic institution in Brazil\
I went to a very traditional school in Rio. It\'92s a catholic (jesuit if that says anything) institution, very known for having alumnus of excellence in different professional fields - and good results on Vestibular (our SATs). High School is when we have a big shift on how school year happens:\

As you can see, students transition from a 7 class curriculum to a 14 class curriculum. Not only it\'92s a heavier workload to get used to, it is also a structure that introduce students to a more complex content, that requires a bigger focus on the learning. The high school curriculum is clearly focused on the Vestibular, so most of the content is taught separately and there is a lot of questions regarding \'93when am i applying this in real life?\'94. Sadly, you can see that we stop having arts class by the sophomore year. As a creative person, I thought this was the thing that I missed the most and having friends that studied in constructivist pedagogy schools, I\'92d always envy them when they told me about their cinema or photography classes. I also feel like the teachers, despite seeing students interest, wouldn\'92t motivate further explorations beyond the class. And this is where I can see the biggest opportunity in change, in engaging students in a better understanding on how the subjects correlate beyond the in class basic knowledge - and how they can lead you to further studies and maybe career paths.\
### Philosophy\
We live in a complex world in which facts are interconnected. Politics & Climate Change, as an example, are correlated, sharing many causes and consequences that are no longer possible to separate them and analyze in a hermetic singular matter. On this atmosphere, the sophomore year of high school should reflect that and be able to introduce to students - already used to the different subjects they\'92ve been studying since the beginning of junior year - how those matters are correlated in class and illustrate these complex relationships through the real world situations.\
### Learning Objective\
Students will learn all the regular curriculum high school through a coexistence lenses, in which they are exposed to how the subjects correlate to each other and how they can see real applications of the learnings they achieve. They will be instigated to collaborate with colleagues that are skilled in different fields to collaborate as a way of being evaluated (instead of the traditional exams).\
### Learning Outcome\
Students will achieve the capacity of thinking about subjects in an interdisciplinary way, learning the mandatory content by collaborating with peers and diving in personal interests. By the end of the year, students will hopefully be instigated to pursue further studies that combines the topics and classes he/she is interested in, facilitating his transition from the last year of high school to college & beyond. They will be able to see clearer what are their passions within the knowledge learnt and help them decide where to go next.}
