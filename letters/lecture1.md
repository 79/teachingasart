# Lecture #1 

Introduction, expectations, schedule. 

- Why I think I'm uniquely qualified to teach this class? 
- Expectations: you will create a material for your workshop. You will try teaching in real life.  

### Teaching as a gift 

- What is my teaching philosophy? 
- Teaching is an act of generosity. 
- Co-learning 
“authentic education is not carried on by “A” for “B” or by “A” about “B,” but rather by “A” with “B." – Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paolo Freire, pg 93, [Problem-posing education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-posing_education) 
- Assesment, feedback mechanism, mechanism to understand the work
- Where does the learning stop? or What are the obstacles in learning?  
- A classroom in conflict, or finding–creating a learning environment in a site of conflict  


### Learner 

"In learning an action, instead of having it given ready-made, one of necessity learns to vary its factors, to make varied combinations of them, according to change of circumstances. A possibility of continuing progress is opened up by the fact that in learning one act, methods are developed good for use in other situations. Still more important is the fact that the human being acquires a habit of learning. He learns to learn."
– [Democracy and Education](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/852/852-h/852-h.htm) by John Dewey

- The secret of teaching effectively is to think in the perspective of someone who's learning 
- From creating a habit to building a habitat   

### Experimenter  

"To Fuller, investigational prototyping was inextricably part of any experimental method—“I designed this thing so it would deliberately fall down, would not stand.” As disorderly as the process of constructing the dome may
have appeared to participants—wet Venetian blinds scattered throughout the landscape of Black Mountain’s Lake Eden campus—the dome was, according to him, engineered and “measured by comprehensive and strict practices of calculation and test.” Fuller wanted students to think structurally about buildings,
questioning underlying engineering principles without accepting formal architectural conventions. He excoriated the way most art and architecture programs “teach otherwise innocent students to make pathetic attempts to out-Mies Mies while overlooking the energetic and economic fundamentals governing development of truly evolutionary design initiative, and design responsibility.” – [The Experimenters, Chance and design at Black Mountain College](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo18291671.html) by Eva Díaz

- Uncertainty and unknowns. being okay with not knowing what will happen 
- [The Black Mountain College Experiment Revisited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlnAvD5_Lws), a talk by Eva Díaz 
- [Black Mountain College: Experiment in Art](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/black-mountain-college) by Vincent Katz  


 

#### Why Art matters? 

- Why it's important to think about 'Teaching as Art'? 
- The art of teaching and teaching of the Art 
- Art has a uniquely transformative power
- There's a potency in Art's resistance to utility 
- For an educator, there's alot to learn from Art and Artists

"Unfortunately today handweaving has degenerated in face of technically superior methods of production. Instead of freely developing new forms, recipes are often used, traditional formulas, which once proved successful. Freshness of invention, of intelligent and imaginative forming has been lost. If handweaving is to regain actual influence on contemporary life, approved repetition has to be replaced with the adventure of new exploring.

The same return to the fundamentals needed for the structural work is also necessary for the combinative or aesthetic side of it, to clear the way for new forming. For the lack of invention often found in the handweaving of today is a general symptom of this time of standardization. If teaching attempts to direct the development of individuals as well as of peoples, it should try to avert a growing onesidedness which may prove fatal. For ability to form materials presupposes responsiveness towards the material, a flexibility of reaction, and this flexibility is one of the factors we will need for times to come. Through working with material we can perhaps develop this ability to respond. More than intangible material, than tones or words, tangible material can teach that it has demands of its own and suggestions of its own for its forming, that it asks for a reaction. Creating means this reacting to material rather than the execution of a dream, as the layman conceives it. The first vision of something to be done gives more the mood of the work than its final form. The form emerges as the work progresses." – [Handweaving Today: Textile Work at Black Mountain College](http://www.albersfoundation.org/teaching/anni-albers/texts/#) by Anni Albers

### Activity 

- Blocks and connections 
- Remember the time you learned something 

### Assignment 

- Mapping my learning (how do I learn something?) 
- It's like a manual for your learning. Manual for someone to teach you. 
- How to submit by making a pull request
