# Lecture #1 

Introduction, expectations, schedule. 

- Why I think I'm uniquely qualified to teach this class? 
- Expectations: you will create a material for your workshop. You will try teaching in real life.  

### Teaching as a gift 

- What is my teaching philosophy? 
- Teaching is an act of generosity. 
- Co-learning 
“authentic education is not carried on by “A” for “B” or by “A” about “B,” but rather by “A” with “B." – Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paolo Freire, pg 93, [Problem-posing education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-posing_education) 
- Assesment, feedback mechanism, mechanism to understand the work
- Where does the learning stop? or What are the obstacles in learning?  
- A classroom in conflict, or finding–creating a learning environment in a site of conflict  


### Learner 

"In learning an action, instead of having it given ready-made, one of necessity learns to vary its factors, to make varied combinations of them, according to change of circumstances. A possibility of continuing progress is opened up by the fact that in learning one act, methods are developed good for use in other situations. Still more important is the fact that the human being acquires a habit of learning. He learns to learn."
– [Democracy and Education](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/852/852-h/852-h.htm) by John Dewey

- The secret of teaching effectively is to think in the perspective of someone who's learning 
- From creating a habit to building a habitat   

### Experimenter  

"To Fuller, investigational prototyping was inextricably part of any experimental method—“I designed this thing so it would deliberately fall down, would not stand.” As disorderly as the process of constructing the dome may
have appeared to participants—wet Venetian blinds scattered throughout the landscape of Black Mountain’s Lake Eden campus—the dome was, according to him, engineered and “measured by comprehensive and strict practices of calculation and test.” Fuller wanted students to think structurally about buildings,
questioning underlying engineering principles without accepting formal architectural conventions. He excoriated the way most art and architecture programs “teach otherwise innocent students to make pathetic attempts to out-Mies Mies while overlooking the energetic and economic fundamentals governing development of truly evolutionary design initiative, and design responsibility.” – [The Experimenters, Chance and design at Black Mountain College](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo18291671.html) by Eva Díaz
